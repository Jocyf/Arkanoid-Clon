Font used: "6809 chargen": https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/typodermic/6809-chargen  

This project only use several sprites for block, ball, background and 2d physics. (No 3d objecs or 3d physics).


Project code notes:
-------------------

This project uses only one scene to show the Main menu and to play, activating/deactivating things properly.

The project has a basic map loader, so you can create new levels using a text editor.

There are several videos explaining all the process there are long videos (all in Spanish)

These videos are Youtuve_Life content, so I'm not only talking about this project, but there is an step by step part en each one that you can follow.
